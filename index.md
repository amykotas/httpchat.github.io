## Tania Rascia

I'm a web designer/developer and tech writer from Chicago. I made my first website in 1998, and many more throughout the years for anything I was interested in, including (but not limited to) Ricky Gervais's failed '80s duo, video games, a comparison of diatonic and chromatic accordions, Digimon, a study of George Michael's facial hair through the years, countless blogs and forums, and parodies of the 90's era 'Net.
